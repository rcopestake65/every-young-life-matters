{{< principles >}}
Children and young people with special education needs and disabilities and their families are the heartbeat of our organisation.

We provide a safe, effective, caring and responsive service which thrives on excellent leadership and values child, family and staff feedback.

We are committed to providing the highest standards of care and support which is why all our care is based on the best and most current evidence.

We work in collaboration with partner health and social care agencies, ensuring a holistic approach to care and promoting effective communication and a seamless transition to other services. 

We value equality and diversity, we are strong advocates of the human rights law and the Disability Act therefore we have made a commitment to making things right for children and young people with SEND and their families.
